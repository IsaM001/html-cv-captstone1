    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am an IT professional, currently a third line engineer but I am aspiring
      to be a web developer. I am learning everyday and getting stuck in
      actually coding. This particular site is my first capstone project. I have
      been given instructions to essentially use what I have learnt so far and
      create a project which is to build a resume using html. I am not following
      along coding as someone else is. Rather this is me coding myself.This will
      be a very basic resume featuring different html elments. I plan on
      uploading this to github just to showcase my skills in html. For context.
      I made this page on 14th September. I started learning Web development
      this week.
